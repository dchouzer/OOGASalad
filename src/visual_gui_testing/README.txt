Version 1.0

To construct different GUI tests

	1) Open EventRecorder.java
	2) Update 'MY_DATA_RECORD' field to output to a certain directory. Make sure to change
	   the file output from MyRecord.ser to the specified test, such as 'test1.ser'. 
	3) Go to the main method inside EventRecorder.java and alter 
	   'new AuthoringView();' to instead construct an instance of your own view
	4) Run EventRecorder.java, which is currently has set a maximum record time of 25 seconds.
	   To extend this record time, update the MAX_RECORD_TIME field. If you want to finish the 
	   recording early, there will be a stop button on the screen that can be pressed to end the
	   recording.
	5) Currently, recorded commands include moving the mouse position and pressing/releasing either 
	   the mouse or a key. 
	
To run the GUI test
	
	1) Ensure the .ser file you want to run is specified within EventRecorder.java under MY_DATA_RECORD
	2) Go to the main method inside EventPlayback.java, and alter 'new AuthoringView()' to instead
	   construct an instance of your own view
	2) Run EventPlayback.java, which will playback recorded GUI events to ensure that all functionality is
	   still working
	
Updated versions will appear over time, with updated instructions in this file.
